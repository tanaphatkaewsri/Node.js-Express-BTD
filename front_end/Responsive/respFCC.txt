/////Responsive Web Design

////1.Intro
-we design and it's can work with every devices
-we know about static site (web site that can't change) -> time to get into responsive frame
-create single screen size -> it's can able to work on any devices
-teaching through projects -> we get a project and learn the difference things
-cover module   -how to approach layout
                -CSS unit : absolute, relative, and percentages
                -Flexbox basic (layout tool)
                -media query basics (adapting to difference screen size)

////2.CSS Units
-Absolute units
    -fixed size, always the same size
    -Pixels(px)
    -pt, cm, mm, in, etc.
    -shouldn't use them, unless doing print styles (style for document to be printed)
-Relative units
    -there are two types of relative units
        -relative to font-size <- focus on this
            -em, rem, and etc.
        -relative to view-port -> (view-port is your browser window)
            -vw, vh, vmin, vmax
-Percentage
    -mainly use for widths (except on height, where things get weird)
    -size relative on their parent

////3.CSS Units - Percentage
-padding -> area around content inside border
-margin -> area around border outside border
-use percentage size of container
    .container {
        width: 50% <- percentage unit mean: it's always 50% from parent (tag parent from this tag that have .container) ex <div class='container'> by the parent is <head> so it's mean width is 50% of width of tag <head>
    }
-all to time parent is default 100% of size web page
